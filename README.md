## Traffic Sign Recognition 

Overview
---
In this project,I used deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. I train and validate a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, I then tested the model on images of German traffic signs that you find on the web.

Steps
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images

Instructions
---
- Open Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb and Traffic_Sign_Classifier.html for code
- Open report.md and for work summary
